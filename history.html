            <!-- Etymology -->
            <h2 class="history-heading2"></h2>
            <p class="history-para">The name Batu Pahat means "chiselled rock" in Malay. The origin of this name can be traced back to a legend in the 15th century; when the invading Siamese troops were chiselling rocks at a rocky spot in the coastal village of Kampung Minyak Beku, in hope of getting fresh water during their retreat. They were being chased by the Melaka troops, being led by Tun Perak, the famous Bendahara (Prime Minister) of the Malacca Empire. In fact, in around 1456, the Siamese army was led by Admiral Awi Di Chu camped in Batu Pahat before attacking Malacca.

            <h3 class="history-heading2"></h3>
            <p class="history-para">Today, the ancient well can still be found in Minyak Beku, though little was done to maintain this ancient landmark which gives its name to the town. For the town's centennial celebration in the early 1990s, a quaint monument depicting a 'floating hand chiselling a rock' was set up in the town square. It became the landmark of the town instantaneously. Currently, the newly refurbished town square is popular with locals to chill out on weekend nights and also provides a venue for many public festive celebrations.</p>

            <h3 class="history-heading2"></h3>
            <p class="history-para">There is also another story detailing the origin of Batu Pahat's name. After capturing Melaka, the Portuguese built the "A Famosa" fortress of granite rocks taken from the mouth of Sungei Batu Pahat. The town acquired its name, which means "chiselled stone" from the quarries near the estuary. Renowned for its salted fish in the past, Batu Pahat was formerly known as Bandar Penggaram, which means town of salt-makers. In 1893, the present township was founded by Dato Bentara Luar, Mohamed Salleh bin Perang, acting on the orders of the Sultan of Johor, Sultan Abu Bakar.</p>
